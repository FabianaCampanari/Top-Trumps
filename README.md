# Top-Trumps

Creation of the Top Trumps game where the theme and cards were inspired by great names responsible for the technology revolution and whom I have enormous admiration. I confess that I was touched several times during the production of this work and I dedicate it to Ada Lovelace to honor her contributions to humanity as one of the leading women in science and math.
If you want to play, Please be my guest!

ps: I suggest full screen mode to enhance experience.
