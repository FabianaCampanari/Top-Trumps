🀄️ Top-Trumps

✨ Creation of the Top Trumps game where the theme and cards were inspired by great names responsible for the technology revolution and whom I have enormous admiration. I confess that I was touched several times during the production of this work and I dedicate it to Ada Lovelace to honor her contributions to humanity as one of the leading women in science and math.

✨ If you want to play... Please be my guest!

✨ ps: I suggest full screen mode to enhance experience.
